<h1>Struggling with Updating to Lime 8? <small>by Shahar Marcus</small></h1>
<br>
<h3>
    Well, you came to the right place!
</h3>
<p>
    <br>
    The new version of Lime 8 is a lot more powerful than the previous one, using more up to date libraries.
    But - theres a catch - Lime 8 gets its libraries straight from <code>git</code>, and that means you need to do
    a couple things for it to work
</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
    <h2>1. Verify You Have Lime 8</h2>
</blockquote>
<br>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 10px;">
    <div>
        <p>
            You can check this by typing <code>haxelib list</code> in your terminal.
            <br>
            Then, you should get something like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            After getting that list, you'll need to check if Lime 8/<code>git</code> is in there.
            (In my case, im using lime from git, which is lime 8)
        </p>
        <img src="./images/Lime-8-2.webp" alt="Lime's library version - version 8/git">
        <p>
            if lime isn't updated, you can either update from haxelib, with <br>
            <h4><code>haxelib update lime</code></h4>
            or, pull the update from git: <br>
            <h4><code>haxelib git lime https://github.com/openfl/lime</code></h4>

            If the wanted version (<code>8</code> or <code>git</code>) isn't surrounded
            by <code>[brackets]</code> set the version: <br>
            <h4><code>haxelib set lime 8</code></h4>
            or: <br>
            <h4><code>haxelib set lime git</code></h4>
        </p>
    </div>
    <img src="./images/Lime-8-1.webp" alt="A display of all haxelib libraries i have installed, and their selected versions">
</div>
<br>
<p>
    If you updated your lime version, restart your code editor to let haxe update the libraries to use.
</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
    <h2>2. Pull The Submodules</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Lime 8 has replaced its forks with git submodules, which means we need to pull those submodules to update
    the libraries inside them.
    <h3>How Should I do that?</h3>
    Actually, quite simple:
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the Lime's containing folder - for example, in my computer its <code>haxelibs/lime</code></li>
        <li>Open a terminal inside that folder, or a terminal that does actions inside that folder</li>
        <li>Type <code>git submodule update --init</code></li>
        <li>Press <code>enter</code>, and wait a bit :)</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
    <h2>3. Rebuild Lime's Tools And Binaries</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Now, after making sure lime and its dependencies are up to date, 
    we can tell lime to rebuild its libraries. that would ensure no core features are missing
    the next time you compile your application.
    <br>
    First, rebuild the lime tools themself, with
    <h4><code>lime rebuild tools</code></h4>
    Second, rebuild your platform-specific binaries:
    <h4><code>lime rebuild windows|mac|linux...</code></h4>
    Third, rebuild your target-specific binaries:
    <h4><code>lime rebuild hl|js...</code></h4>
</p>
<br>
Now, the next step, is to compile, and enjoy ;)
