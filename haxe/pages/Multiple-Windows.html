<h1>OpenFL - With Multiple Windows <small>by Shahar Marcus</small></h1>

<p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
    A while ago, I started investigating multi-window support in haxe - 
    I just wanted my applications's settings tab to be a seperate window. Sounds simple enough, right? <br> 
    Well, yeah, But - I got "Unlucky" - For that app's development I used the game framework <a href="https://haxeflixel.com">HaxeFlixel</a>, 
    and that framework isn't really designed With multiple windows in mind 
    (well, you can't blame it - its a game framework after all).<br><br>

    But that didn't make me give up - I started looking for other windowing solutions, and it took a while, because, 
    for some reason, i never considered just not using HaxeFlixel for that - 
    But dont judge me, i never did anything without HaxeFlixel At that point...<br><br>

    only a week or so later, after i gave up on the multi-window stuff, it dawned on me i can just use lime and openfl for that, <br>
    <b>And thats exactly what this tutorial is all about:</b>
</p>
<blockquote><h2>Setting Up The Window</h2></blockquote>
<p>
    <i>before i continue, make sure you have the haxelibs <b>Lime</b> and <b>OpenFL</b> installed</i>
</p>
<p>
    Lets first create the window, and assign it to a variable.<br>
    That variable can be local, class level, static, whatever you want 
    (in this example, I'll use local variables):<br><br>
</p>
    <pre style="padding: 0px;"><code>
        // At the top of the file
        import openfl.Lib;

        //later
        final window = Lib.application.createWindow({
			width: 400,
			height: 400,
			x: 0,
			y: 0,
			title: "Hey There!",
			resizable: true
		});
    </code></pre>

        <h3>What does this code do?</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">
            This code assigns a window to the variable named <code>window</code>.<br>
            As for the curly brackets, those represent the <code>WindowAttributes</code> parameter. Basically,
            Were creating a 400x400 window, at the top-left of the screen, titled "Hey There!", and the window is resizable.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
<p>
    Now, we have the created window stored inside the variable <code>window</code>.<br>
    If you use intellisense in your editor, you might have noticed the <code>stage</code> field under the <code>window</code> variable.<br>
    From now on, we're going to work with the stage.
</p>

    If you are a HaxeFlixel user, you need to get out of your comfort zone for a bit, because were starting with OpenFL!
</b>
<blockquote><h2>Sprites and Bitmaps</h2></blockquote>
<p>
    The first thing I'll show you how to do is add a sprite to that window. its not that complicated - trust me!<br><br>

        <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">
            OpenFL and HaxeFlixel are actually very similar. for this tutorial, i suggest memorizing the similarities between the two:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>

                    <td>
                        <b>OpenFL</b>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                        <code>new FlxSprite()</code>

                    <td>
                        <code>new Bitmap()</code>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>new FlxSpriteGroup()</code>

                    <td>
                        <code>new Sprite()</code>

                    <td>
                        <code>.loadGraphic("path/to/image.png")</code>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <code>BitmapData.fromFile("path/to/image.png")</code>

                </tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>add(sprite);</code>

                    <td>
                        <code>addChild(sprite);</code>

            That sprite is an instance of the <code>MySprite</code> class, which we created later.
            that class simply displays an image, here it displays the one stored at <code>assets/image.png</code>.
            after initializing the sprite, we add it to the stage.

<p>
    Here, We made a new class the extends the <code>Sprite</code> class - we want to add it to the stage.
    That sprite simply displays an image.

    After running that code, you can see we have a sprite on the extra window's screen:<br>
    <i>image here</i>
    <br><br>
    I'll continue writing this in a couple of hours, but for now, thats enough to get you started x)
