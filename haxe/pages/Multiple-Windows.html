<h1>OpenFL - With Multiple Windows <small>by Shahar Marcus</small></h1>

<p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
    A while ago, I started investigating multi-window support in Haxe -
    I just wanted my applications's settings tab to be a separate window. Sounds simple enough, right? <br>
    Well, yeah, But - I got "Unlucky" - For that app's development I used the game framework <a
        href="https://haxeflixel.com">HaxeFlixel</a>,
    and that framework isn't really designed With multiple windows in mind
    (well, you can't blame it - its a game framework after all).<br><br>

    But that didn't make me give up - I started looking for other windowing solutions, and it took a while, because,
    for some reason, I never considered just not using HaxeFlixel for that -
    But don't judge me, I never did anything without HaxeFlixel At that point...<br><br>

    only a week or so later, after I gave up on the multi-window stuff, it dawned on me i can just use lime and openfl
    for that, <br>
    <b>And thats exactly what this tutorial is all about:</b>
</p>

    <h2>Setting Up The Window</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>
    <i>before I continue, make sure you have the haxelibs <b>Lime</b> and <b>OpenFL</b> installed</i>
</p>
<p>
    Lets first create the window, and assign it to a variable.<br>
    That variable can be local, class level, static, whatever you want
    (in this example, I'll use local variables):<br><br>
</p>
<pre class="grid programming" style="padding: 0px; align-content: space-between; justify-content:space-between; flex-flow:row wrap; padding-right: 10px;">
    <code>
        // At the top of the file
        import openfl.Lib;
        import lime.ui.WindowAttributes;

        //later
        final window = Lib.application.createWindow({
			width: 400,
			height: 400,
			x: 0,
			y: 0,
			title: "Hey There!",
			resizable: true
		});
    </code>
    <a href="./images/Multi-Window-1.webp"><img src="./images/Multi-Window-1.webp" alt="new 400 by 400 window titled &quot;Hey There!&quot; at the top left of the screen" style="aspect-ratio: 455/474; width: 20vw; vertical-align: center; min-width: 200px;"/></a>
</pre>

    <h3>What does this code do?</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">
        This code assigns a window to the variable named <code>window</code>.<br>
        As for the curly brackets, those represent the <code>WindowAttributes</code> parameter. Basically,
        Were creating a 400x400 window, at the top-left of the screen, titled "Hey There!", and the window is resizable.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Now, we have the created window stored inside the variable <code>window</code>.<br>
    If you use intellisense in your editor, you might have noticed the <code>stage</code> field under the
    <code>window</code> variable.<br>
    From now on, we're going to work with the stage.

    If you are a HaxeFlixel user, you need to get out of your comfort zone for a bit, because were starting with OpenFL!

    <h2>Sprites and Bitmaps</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The first thing I'll show you how to do is add a sprite to that window. for our image, were going to use this masterpiece:

    <h3>Haxeflixel users - Notice:</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">
        OpenFL and HaxeFlixel are actually very similar. for this tutorial, i suggest memorizing the similarities
        between the two:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <b>HaxeFlixel</b>
            </td>
            <td>
                <b>OpenFL</b>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <code>new FlxSprite()</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>new Bitmap()</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <code>new FlxSpriteGroup()</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>new Sprite()</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <code>.loadGraphic("path/to/image.png")</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>BitmapData.fromFile("path/to/image.png")</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <td>
            <code>add(sprite);</code>
        </td>
        <td>
            <code>addChild(sprite);</code>
        </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">
        After we create the window, we access the stage, and add our sprite to it.
        <br>
        That sprite is an instance of the <code>MySprite</code> class, which we created later.
        that class simply displays an image, here it displays the one stored at <code>assets/image.png</code>.
        after initializing the sprite, we add it to the stage.

<p>
    Here, We made a new class the extends the <code>Sprite</code> class - we want to add it to the stage.
    That sprite simply displays an image.

    After running that code, you can see we have a sprite on the extra window's screen:<br><br>
    
    And thats pretty much it for the Basics! <br><br>
