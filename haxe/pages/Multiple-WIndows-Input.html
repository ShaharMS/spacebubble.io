<h1>Input, But With Multiple Windows <small>by Shahar Marcus</small></h1>

<p>
    In OpenFL, input (and objects in general) are stored and managed "per group" - inside Sprites, Stages, and other custom groups.
    This systems actually scales up really well with multiple windows, since most of the time those objects are window/container specific, and dont need
    to communicate with the "outer world".
</p>
<p>
    But we have a problem when it comes to input:<br>
    Sometimes, we want to have a key combination/an event launched when a user does something inside your game/app, no matter what window/container it is in.
</p>
<p>
    But input (or events in general) are handled per group. So, How do we overcome this?
</p>
<p>
    Well, recently, I had an idea - lime gives us event listeners for when 
    windows lose focus, so why shouldnt we use that?
</p>
<p>
    Lime has two main events regarding window focus:
    <ul>
        <li><code>window.onFocusIn</code> - when a window gains focus</li>
        <li><code>window.onFocusOut</code> - when a window loses focus</li>
    </ul>
    But, if you try checking them out, youll notice they arent just functions
    you can assign to and call, but a special "object" that handles events:
</p>
<p>
    Each of those events has these properties:
</p>
<table class="table-bordered table">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>event.add()</code></td>
            <td>adds an event listener, which is a function that gets called when the event dispatches</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>event.remove()</code></td>
            <td>removes an event listener, which is a function that gets called when the event dispatches</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>event.has()</code></td>
            <td>checks if an event listener is attached to the event</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>event.dispatch()</code></td>
            <td>dispatches an event, In which you add the parameters usually given by that event</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>event.cancel()</code></td>
            <td>cancels this event. That means this event wont dispatch its attached callbacks anymore</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>event.canceled</code></td>
            <td>checks whether or not this event is canceled.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>event.removeAll()</code></td>
            <td>removes all event listeners attached to this event</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><code>event.__listeners</code></td>
            <td>an array of all event listeners attached to this event</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
