<h1>Input, But With Multiple Windows <small>by Shahar Marcus</small></h1>

<p>
    In OpenFL, input (and objects in general) are stored and managed "per group" - inside Sprites, Stages, and other custom groups.
    This systems actually scales up really well with multiple windows, since most of the time those objects are window/container specific, and dont need
    to communicate with the "outer world".
</p>
<p>
    But we have a problem when it comes to input:<br>
    Sometimes, we want to have a key combination/an event launched when a user does something inside your game/app, no matter what window/container it is in.
</p>
<p>
    But input (or events in general) are handled per group. So, How do we overcome this?
