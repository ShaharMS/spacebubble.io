    <code>Sys_error</code> is one of the most annoying errors when compiling haxe code, 
    and its the error that inspired me to make this subfolder of guides ðŸ’€<br>

    On this one, were unlucky; this error is a compiler error :(<br>
    But, Don't you worry, we're gonna solve that together!<br>
    <br>
    You might have noticed that this error also triggers on non-sys platforms,
    such as JS and Flash. Thats because this error doesn't depend on the code you write:<br>
    <b>Its just a file permission error...</b>
</p>

    Because this error gets triggered because of file permission problems, we might want to check the 
    build folder's permissions. - it might block certain apps or forms of access to that folder, thus
    triggering a plethora of error types, including the one you probably came here to solve - 
    <code>Sys_error("bad file descriptor")</code>
