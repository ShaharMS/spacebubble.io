                        <b>beta</b> means the application is closer to release, but still has some quirks. <br>
                        <b>rc</b> means the application is very close to official release, and is pretty much fully usable, maybe missing some features. <br>
                        <b>No prefix</b> means the application is officialy released.

            <h2>What is EZWorksheet?</h2>
        
            <p>EZWorksheet is an app that lets you take worksheets in multiple
                formats (image, pdf, docx) and complete them, just like you would on paper - 
                with text boxes placed where you need to type. <br>
                The app also lets you group those pages into workbooks of specific subjects,
                allowing the app to be an all-in-one solution for mess involving school worksheets :).
